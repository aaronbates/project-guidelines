# Project guidelines

These guidelines are both convention based _and_ opinionated. They are designed for use in my personal projects and represent a combination of industry best-practice and my own preferences.

> "Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors."

— The Golden Rule

## Why have guidelines?

There is really no universal "correct" when it comes to how you write code or how you build projects — it's about creating a system that:

1. Helps you focus on producing great work.
2. Produces work that can be maintained long-term.
4. Can scale up for larger teams and projects if needed.
5. Makes it easy to on-board new staff and contributors.

A "coding styleguide" is typically more suited to product teams, but I believe all developers should strive for a degree of standardisation and order in their code.

When followed, guidelines will:

- Set the standard for code quality across a project.
- Promote consistency and accuracy.
- Give contributors a feeling of familiarity across codebases.
- Increase productivity (hopefully!)

### Strong opinions, loosely held.
I fully recognise that there are _many_ approaches different to mine which are as good or better. I've used many and am totally pragmatic.

> Pick the right tool for the job: it's about the solution, not the implementation.

To reference [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)), when it comes to [Tabs vs. Spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI), I'm sort of a "Tabs or Spaces" guy. They're both fine.

## What do they cover?

These guidelines are designed to enable consistent and clear work on projects — for each technology they define:

1. Approach, guidance and rules.
2. Templates, scaffolding and frameworks.
3. Style guides and copywriting.
4. Supporting resources.

_Note: Guidelines will link to any personal or third-party boilerplate repos for use or reference._
